## What I learned

### CSS

Although using CSS grid would have been easier and more efficient during this project. The direction to use flexbox definitely helped to solidify my understanding of it. 

I learnt how to utilise gradients to accent my page design

Implementing a range slider, although i think I still have some work to do in regards to the styling of said slider!

### JavaScript

This is the first project where I really got to work with manipulating the DOM via JS, at first it did confuse me somewhat as I tried to get a grasp on all the moving parts. Especially the event listeners! I found that while trying to add functionality to the buttons something clicked and they no longer seem as daunting to me. There must be some extremely creative use cases for event listeners which I'm eager to get stuck into! 

I was able to speed up the performance of my game by reworking my JavaScript file, removing what I realised to be unnecessary for loops.

## Conclusion

In conclusion I feel this project has helped to solidify a lot of the concepts I have been researching, It's leaving me eager to explore the more dynamic side of webDevelopment and how to use data structures to improve my codes modularity and efficiency.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my Etch-A-Sketch game! ðŸš€
